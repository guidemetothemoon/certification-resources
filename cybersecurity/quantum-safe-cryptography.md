### 2022 Summary of current situation on quantum-safe cryptography

With acceleration of development of quantum computers it has become clear that current cryptographic techniques and cryptographic algorithms will face great challenges once quantum computers become publicly available. Current data protection mechanisms heavily rely on a collection of well-proven and well-known cryptographic algorithms which in return heavily rely on implementations that can't be broken with computing power that is currently available. With advancement and public availability of quantum computers such implementations will become pretty easy and straightforward to solve. 
What makes it even scarier is the fact that you can steal data that's encrypted now and keep it stored until a quantum computer with enough computing power becomes available. Once it's available all previously encrypted data can be decrypted.
