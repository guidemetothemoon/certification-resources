The level of detail in this book is very good - it doesn't only provide you insight into considerations you need to take in order to build a cloud native application, but it also provides you fundamental knowledge of modern software architecture. During the course of the book you get to learn about containerization, orchestration with Kubernetes, microservices architecture, serverless computing, DevOps and much more in the context of building Cloud Native apps. Often examples of tools are provided, both for Azure and other cloud providers like AWS.

If you're not able to read the whole book I would recommend to focus on two last chapters:

💫 **"Chapter 6: Best practises"** sums up really which areas you need to focus on and plan for when modernizing a legacy application for #cloud or when building a new cloud native application;

💫 **"Chapter 7: Portability"** is interesting and relevant in the world of GDPR, Schrems II and data #privacy concerns. How can you make your application portable and when would it make sense to avoid vendor lock-in? There's always a trade-off and if #portability is a requirement then you must know what it will cost you to support it in your application.

**Book quote highlight:**

> "To truly move to the cloud native architecture, you need to decouple data as well. Your data migration strategy might consist of multiple phases, especially if you can't migrate everything at the same time."☁️

Good read!😺

The content of the book is of high quality and I liked that the book focuses on learning by doing from Chapter 1. It can be especially useful if you have just started with Azure Kubernetes Service and want to get your hands dirty, but as a more advanced user I’ve also learned something new.😼 The book gradually builds up the knowledge base, starting with the basics of running an application on AKS to monitoring, storing secrets, securing network and setting up CI/CD for AKS. 

I really liked Chapter 14 about running serverless functions on AKS and Chapter 12 about using Azure Service Operator to create Azure resources from within a Kubernetes cluster.
