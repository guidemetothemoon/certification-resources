The content of the book is of high quality and I liked that the book focuses on learning by doing from Chapter 1. It can be especially useful if you have just started with Azure Kubernetes Service and want to get your hands dirty, but as a more advanced user I’ve also learned something new.😼 The book gradually builds up the knowledge base, starting with the basics of running an application on AKS to monitoring, storing secrets, securing network and setting up CI/CD for AKS. 

I really liked Chapter 14 about running serverless functions on AKS and Chapter 12 about using Azure Service Operator to create Azure resources from within a Kubernetes cluster.
